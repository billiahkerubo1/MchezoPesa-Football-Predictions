# MchezoPesa-Football-Predictions

INTRODUCTION

MchezoPesa Limited is a football company. As a data analyst, I have to make predictions through the analysis of the available records including the team goals and the tournament type.

The first step was data cleaning. There were no missing values but the duplicated values were dropped. The next step was exploratory data analysis to understand the data so that the correct model was obtained to ensure the correct predictions were made. The accuracy test fro prediction was also conducted. The classifier used in this case was GridSearch.
